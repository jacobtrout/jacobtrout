### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for visiting my GitHub.

I'm Jacob Trout, a [Computational Analysis and Public Policy](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) graduate student at the University of Chicago ðŸŽ“

- I'm currently a Data Science Intern at Neuberger Berman, where I design large-scale data pipelines, build predictive models for mortgage loan behavior, and develop interactive dashboards to support fixed income investment decisions.

- Previously, I worked as a Consultant at Deloitte and Summit Consulting, where I built econometric and machine learning models for federal agencies including Ginnie Mae, FHA, and NCUA. My work helped inform stress testing, risk analysis, and policy decisions in the mortgage finance space.

- I'm passionate about leveraging data science to support evidence-based policy and financial resilience. My work blends cloud computing, machine learning, and causal inference with a focus on real-world impact.

## Past Projects

- **Mortgage Loan ML Pipeline**: Built an end-to-end application to ingest 500+ GB of mortgage data into Snowflake, train CatBoost models to predict loan delinquency and prepayment, and deploy model outputs via an interactive Flask dashboard.
- **[CommonThread: Civic Tech Story Collection & Analysis Platform](https://github.com/uchicago-capp-30320/CommonThread?tab=readme-ov-file)** â€“ As backend engineer and ML specialist, I designed and implemented the ML task scheduling workflow for analyzing narrative data, supporting asynchronous processing and evidence-based insights.  
  [Live Application](http://turing.unnamed.computer:8031/)
- **[Corn and Climate: Midwestern Trends Over the Last Half Century](https://cornandclimate.netlify.app/)**  
  This interactive data visualization project examines regional trends in climate and corn production from 1980 to 2023. It integrates county-level corn production and climate data from the USDA and NOAA, offering interactive maps to visualize nominal values and relative changes over time. Users can compare metrics such as corn yields, temperatures, and precipitation across Midwest counties.
- [Energy sector analysis of US](https://github.com/uchicago-mscapp-projects/watts_up)
  This project ingests energy generation data from across the US over the past 20 years and displays visualizations highlighting trends in generation sources over time, providing insights into the evolving landscape of US energy production via a Dash app.
- **Credit Risk Stress Testing**: Led modeling work for Ginnie Maeâ€™s non-bank issuer stress tests, building econometric models with Bloomberg and Moodyâ€™s data.
- **Cashflow Forecasting for FHA**: Developed a multistage SAS-based forecast model to evaluate $1.3 trillion in insured mortgages for quarterly reporting.
- **COVID-Era Policy Impact Analysis**: Conducted simulations and developed dashboards to track the impact of natural disasters and COVID-19 on federal mortgage portfolios.


_Many academic projects are in private repos due to academic integrity requirements. Code samples available upon request._

- **Distributed System for Genomic Annotation Services**: Built with AWS services (S3, Glacier, DynamoDB, State Machines, Lambda, SQS/SNS) for scalable genomic data processing.
- **Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5)**: Fine-tuned a T5 model for text summarization tasks.
- **Transformer Architecture Replication**: Replicated the "Attention is All You Need" model using PyTorch.
- **Markov Models for Text Attribution**: Analyzed text authorship using probabilistic models.
- **Web Scraping & Crawlers**: Built with lxml for structured data extraction.
- **CRUD App for Tweet Management**: Developed a Flask/SQLite application to handle tweets and link records.
- **Record Linkage Algorithms**: Engineered algorithms for dataset matching and merging.
- **Avian Diversity Analysis**: Visualized species distribution using recursive treemaps.
- **Polling Precinct Simulation**: Modeled voter wait times using M/M/N queue theory.
- **Political Tweet Analysis**: Applied NLP to classify sentiment in political social media data.
- **Epidemic Simulation**: Simulated disease spread using the SIR model.
